# Content Management System Project 🖥

**This is my Software Construction And Developments Course project, consisting of 3 assignments where I meticulously designed and developed a robust Content Management System (CMS). 🚀**

## Overview

Welcome to my interactive README for the Content Management System (CMS) project! 🌐 This project is a culmination of my efforts in the Software Construction And Developments course, where I undertook a comprehensive journey from conceptualization to implementation.

## Project Structure

### Assignment 1: Class Diagrams 📊

In the first assignment, I focused on breaking down the system into detailed class diagrams. 📝 Each class represents a key component of the CMS, providing a blueprint for the overall structure.

### Assignment 2: Data, Routines, and Internal Routines Design 📑

For the second assignment, I transitioned from class diagrams to a more detailed phase, encompassing data design, routine specifications, and internal routines. 💽 This involved defining how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated within the CMS, as well as outlining essential routines for seamless functionality.

### Assignment 3: Implementation 🚧

The final stretch solely involved refining internal routines and implementing the CMS. 🛠️ This phase brought the theoretical designs to life, ensuring a functional and efficient system. I paid close attention to detail, aiming for a user-friendly and scalable solution.
